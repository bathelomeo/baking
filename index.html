    Your taste buds are the primary factor in what makes pizza special.
    An important feature is a good pizza.
    All the ingredients should be fresh 
    All the ingredients should balace each other.
    Having the right amount of cheese.
    Having the right amount of tomato sauce.
    That that is what makes a good pizza for most people.
    Having it all in harmony is what i like about pizza.
    For me i think of it as music notes it has fall to place in harmony.
    Pizza itself is not that healthy but some of the topings you choose are.
